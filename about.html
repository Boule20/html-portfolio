<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 20-year-old web developer whose super passionate about building cool stuff online. When i am not stuck in code you can find me pumping iron at the gym- working out is my stress reliefe</p>

<p>My faith is a huge part of my life, and i try to live it out every da. I'm a Christian who believes in being a light in the dark and i strive to be a good example to those around me. Fun fact, i am obsessed with the Netflix series Sweet Tooth - it's my go-to show.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm diving into the latest book by Sarah Jakes Roberts "Power Moves", Her writting is so inspiring! I love how she challenges me to be a better version of myself. All in all, i'm just trying to live my best life, one rep and one line of code at a time.</p>
